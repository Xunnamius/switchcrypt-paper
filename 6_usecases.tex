\section{\sys Case Studies} \label{sec:usecases}

\PUNT{In this section, we provide three case studies demonstrating the practical
utility of cipher switching. We cover a wide range of situations, highlighting
concerns like meeting latency goals (\cref{subsec:uc3}), trading off security
and writable space (\cref{subsec:uc2}), and keeping within an energy budget
(\cref{subsec:uc1}). We also demonstrate the utility of both temporal and
spatial switching strategies, exploring the range of conditions under which
certain strategies are optimal.}

\subsection{Balancing Security Goals with a Hard Energy Cap} \label{subsec:uc1}

Here we revisit the motivating example given in the extended abstract
of this work. It illustrates that, because latency and energy use are
correlated among the ciphers we examined, we can switch ciphers to
save battery life or to maintain confidentiality when uploading
encrypted backups to our enterprise solution. \hank{It probably seems
  small, but you want to avoid saying things like ``we can switch
  ciphers,'' and say that ``\sys allows us to easily swtich
  ciphters.''  We could do it today at a huge inconvenience, the point
  is that \sys makes it practical.}

To simulate I/O activity, we begin randomly writing 10 40MB files
using the Freestyle Balanced cipher configuration over the course of
approximately 120-125 seconds. After 5 seconds, the device enters
``battery saver'' mode, also pausing backup uploads. We simulate this
event by 1) underclocking the cores to their lowest frequencies and 2)
using \texttt{taskset} to transition the \sys processes to the
energy-efficient LITTLE cores. After this event, we complete the
remaining workload using the ChaCha8 cipher. We repeat this experiment
three times. \hank{Like above comment, you want to phrase this in
  terms of \sys and concepts you have already defined.  So
  instead of saying we complete it using ChaCha8, talk about how the
  OS changes \sys's active cipher from FS to CC8, and from that
  point on...}

\begin{figure}[ht] \textbf{Battery Saver: A Strict Energy
   Budget vs Time}\par\medskip
   \centering
   {\input{data/usecase-battery.tex}} \caption{Median sequential write total
   energy use over time.}
  \label{fig:usecase-battery}
\end{figure}

In \figref{usecase-battery}, we see time versus energy used. At 0 seconds, we
begin writing. At 5 seconds, the ``battery saver'' event occurs, causing the
system to be underclocked. At 120 seconds, the system will die. If we blow past
our energy ceiling, the system will die.

Our goal is to complete I/O before the device dies. We have three cipher
configuration choices. 1) Favor security even when backups are paused and use
Freestyle Balanced exclusively. Our results show that the device will die before
I/O completes. 2) Favor low energy use even when backups are being uploaded and
use ChaCha8 exclusively. Our results show that the device will finish writing
early, but we cannot safely upload backups when nuggets are encrypted using
ChaCha8. Finally, we have 3) favor security and use Freestyle Balanced when
uploading backups, and switch to ChaCha8 when the system enters the low power
state. Our results show that, while the system uses slightly more power in the
short term, we stay within our energy budget and finish before the devices dies.
Further, when we get our device to a charger, \sys can converge nuggets
back to Freestyle Balanced and resume uploading backups.

On average, using Forward cipher switching resulted in a 3.3x total
energy use reduction compared to exclusively using Freestyle Balanced,
allowing us to remain within our energy budget. We note, however, that
the energy savings is not the point of this experiment. Rather, the
lesson learned is that \sys enables the system to move to the
right point in the energy/security tradeoff space so that the current
task can still be accomplished before the battery is drained and
without compromising backup security at any point.  \hank{The numbers
  on these results are amazing, but in the chart it looks like there
  is hardly any difference between them.  Is there any way to play
  around with the parameters to get more separation between the
  curves?  Also, the naming on the chart legend is doing you the worst
  possible service.  You should have a line labeled ``SwitchCrupt.''
  Maybe label the other ones Static (ChaCha8) and Static (FS) or
  something.  You also might label the chart with the key moments, you
  have battery critical, but there is just one battery dies. Shouldn't
  it die at different times with SwitchCrupt? MAybe you run the x-axis
  out so that you can see there is a long period of time where
  \sys keeps going, but the others have died? (Or just FS dies,
  and jsut use that as the single point of comaprison).}

\subsection{Variable Security Regions} \label{subsec:uc2}

This usecase illustrates utility of spatial Selective switching to achieve a
performance win over prior work where the entire drive is encrypted with a
single cipher. We demonstrate \emph{Variable Security Regions} (VSR), where we
can choose to encrypt select files or portions of files with different keys and
ciphers below the filesystem level.

Storing classified materials, corporate secrets, etc. require the highest level
of discretion, yet sensitive information like this can appear within a (much)
larger amount of data that we value less. But if only a small percentage of the
data needs the strongest encryption, then only a small percentage of the data
should have that associated overhead. In this scenario, a user wants to indicate
one or more regions of a file are more sensitive than the others. For example,
perhaps banking transaction information is littered throughout a PDF; perhaps
passwords and other sensitive information exists within several much larger
files. Using prior techniques, either all the data would be stored with high
overhead, the critical data would be stored without the mandated cipher type, or
the data would have to be split among separate files requiring potentially
complex and error-prone management schemes. \sys VSRs allows us to
sidestep these issues.

We begin by with 10 5MB and 4KB write-read operations to two
\sys instances: one using ChaCha8 (C8) and the other using Freestyle
Strong (FS). These results represent I/O without cipher switching where 100\% of
the data is stored with either high overhead (FS) or using an inappropriate
cipher (C8). We then use a third \sys instance initialized with Selective
switching and write-read with a 7:3 ratio of ChaCha8 versus Freestyle
Balanced I/O operations. Here, 30\% of the data is considered sensitive. We
repeat this experiment three times.

\begin{figure}[ht] \textbf{VSR: ChaCha8 vs Freestyle Strong Sequential
    4KB, 5MB}\par\medskip \centering
  {\input{data/usecase-vsr-bar.tex}} \caption{Median I/O performance
    comparison of ChaCha8 vs Freestyle Strong 4KB, 5MB I/O with 7-to-3
    ratio. \hank{Again, where is switch crupt in this figure?  It
      should be labeled.  Also, it is not obvious from this figure
      that switch crypt is actually better than these other
      approaches.  The figure makes it look like ChaCha is the best.}}
  \label{fig:usecase-vsr-bar}
\end{figure}

In \figref{usecase-vsr-bar}, we see the sequential read and write performance of
4KB and 5MB workloads when nuggets are encrypted exclusively with ChaCha8 or
Freestyle Balanced. Between them, we see Selective switching 7:3 ratio I/O
results.

Our goal is to use VSRs to keep our sensitive data at the mandated security
level while keeping the performance and battery life benefits of using a fast
cipher for the majority of I/O operations. Using \sys Selective switching
versus prior work results in a reduction of 3.1x to 4.8x for read latency and
1.6x to 2.8x for write latency, all without compromising the security needs of
the most sensitive data.

\subsection{Responding to End-of-Life Slowdown in SSDs} \label{subsec:uc3}

This usecase illustrates using temporal Forward switching to offset the
debilitating decline in performance when SSDs reach end-of-life
(EoL)~\cite{SSDEOL1}. We demonstrate the utility of such a system to dynamically
stay within a strict latency budget while meeting minimum security requirements,
which is not possible using prior work.

Due to garbage collection and wear-leveling requirements of SSDs, as free space
becomes constrained, I/O performance drops precipitously~\cite{SSDEOL1}. With
prior work, our strict latency ceiling is violated. However, if \sys is
made aware when the drive is in such a state, we can offset some of the
performance loss by switching the ciphers of high traffic nuggets to the fastest
acceptable cipher available using Forward switching.

We begin by writing 10 40MB files to \sys per each cipher as a baseline.
We then introduce a delay into \sys I/O of $20ms$, simulating drive
slowdown, and repeat the experiment three times.

\begin{figure}[ht] \textbf{SSD EoL: Latency-Security Tradeoff vs
   Goals}\par\medskip {\input{data/usecase-eol-tradeoff.tex}} \caption{Median
   40MB I/O performance comparison: baseline versus simulated faulty device.}
  \label{fig:usecase-eol-tradeoff}
\end{figure}

In \figref{usecase-eol-tradeoff}, we see the sequential and random read and
write performance of a 40MB workload when nuggets are encrypted exclusively with
our choice ciphers. While the latency ceiling and security floor have not
changed, we see increased latency in the delayed workloads.

Our goal is to remain under the latency ceiling while remaining above
the security floor. Thanks to Forward switching, accesses to highly
trafficked areas of the drive can remain performant even during drive
end-of-life.  \hank{The same general comments I made about the other
  case studies apply here as well.}

%Full-drive encryption (FDE) is a primary concern among several in modern systems
%increasingly backed by solid-state storage. 
Full-drive encryption (FDE) is essential for security in modern computing
systems, especially mobile systems. Recent work with stream-cipher based FDE
shows significantly improved I/O throughput over block cipher based FDE while
offering stronger security guarantees. This approach is ideal when the only
optimization target is throughput; however, high performance I/O often conflicts
with other key concerns like the strength of the encryption and energy usage.

In this paper, we show that drive management requires navigating a tradeoff
space between energy, security, and performance. We further characterize this
space and present \SYSTEM{}, a software mechanism to navigate such a space
dynamically and at runtime via \emph{cipher switching}, which can be done in
space or time. The key insight in this approach is achieving low-overhead
switching by leveraging the overwrite-averse, append-mostly behavior of the
underlying solid-state storage to trade throughput or total energy use for
desired security guarantees. We implement \SYSTEM{} on an ARM big.LITTLE mobile
processor and test its performance under the popular F2FS LFS. We find that
\SYSTEM{}'s flexibility satisfies a wide range of performance and security
constraints. \TODO{Perhaps a sentence-long general explanation of the use cases
and the most interesting result(s) from them?}

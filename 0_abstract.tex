\begin{abstract}

Full-drive encryption (FDE) is a primary concern among several in modern systems
increasingly backed by solid-state storage. Prior work with stream cipher based
FDE demonstrates that, by selecting the fastest stream cipher statically at
compile time, we can achieve improved I/O throughput over block cipher based FDE
while offering stronger security guarantees. This is ideal when the only
optimization target is throughput; however, throughput is not the only primary
concern---others frequently include security and energy use. For instance: the
cipher with the highest throughput may not provide security guarantees at the
desired strength; similarly, the cipher with the strongest security guarantees
may not be efficient enough given the current energy budget.

In this paper, we show these competing concerns form a tradeoff space between
energy, security, and performance. We further characterize this space and
present \SYSTEM{}, a software mechanism to navigate such a space dynamically and
at runtime via \emph{cipher scheduling}. This is accomplished by taking
advantage of the overwrite-averse "append-mostly" behavior of the underlying
solid-state storage to trade throughput or total energy use of the file system
for desired security guarantees. We implement \SYSTEM{} on an ARM big.LITTLE
mobile processor and test its performance under the popular F2FS LFS. We find
that \SYSTEM{} is flexible enough to satisfy a wide range of performance and
security constraints. \TODO{Perhaps a sentence-long general explanation of the
use cases and the most interesting result(s) from them?}

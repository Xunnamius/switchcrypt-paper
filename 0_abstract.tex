\begin{abstract}

Full-drive encryption (FDE) is a tier-one concern in modern systems increasingly
backed by solid-state storage. By leveraging the proliferation of trusted
hardware and the behavior of solid-state Flash Translation Layers (FTL)---which
operate similarly to Log-structured File Systems (LFS)---we can improve I/O
performance by as much as $2.36\times$ while offering stronger integrity
guarantees than the state of the art. But this append-mostly overwrite-averse
FTL/LFS behavior is further exploitable. By taking advantage of this behavior,
we can trade off I/O performance or total filesystem energy use for stronger
security guarantees without loss of generality.

In this paper, we demonstrate that this trade off space exists. We further
characterize this space and provide a software mechanism to navigate it: the
\SYSTEM{} filesystem. We implement \SYSTEM{} on an ARM big.LITTLE mobile
processor and test its performance under the popular F2FS LFS. We find that
\SYSTEM{} is flexible enough to satisfy a wide range of performance and security
constraints. \TODO{Perhaps a sentence-long general explanation of the use cases
and the most interesting result(s) from them.}

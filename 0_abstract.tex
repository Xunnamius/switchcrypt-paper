Recent work on Full Drive Encryption shows that stream ciphers achieve
significantly improved performance over block ciphers while offering stronger
security guarantees. However, optimizing for performance often conflicts with
other key concerns like energy usage and desired security properties. In this
paper we present \sys{}, a software mechanism that navigates the tradeoff
space made by balancing competing security and latency requirements via
\emph{cipher switching} in space or time. \hank{Need a sentence on the impact of implementing this work.  what are the results? What can you do now that \sys{} exists that you couldn't do before?}

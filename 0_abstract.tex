Full-drive encryption (FDE) is essential for security in modern computing
systems, especially mobile systems. Recent work with stream-cipher based FDE
shows significantly improved throughput over block cipher based FDE while
offering stronger security guarantees. This approach is ideal when the only
optimization target is throughput; however, optimizing for high throughput often
conflicts with other key concerns like the strength of the encryption and energy
usage.

In this paper, we show that optimal FDE requires navigating a configuration
space of different stream ciphers. We then present SwitchBox, a software
mechanism to navigate this space dynamically via \emph{cipher switching}, which
can be done in space or time. The key insight in this approach is achieving
low-overhead switching by leveraging the overwrite-averse, append-mostly
behavior of the underlying solid-state storage to trade throughput or total
energy use for desired security guarantees. We implement SwitchBox on an ARM
big.LITTLE mobile processor and test its performance under the popular F2FS LFS.
We find that SwitchBox's flexibility satisfies a wide range of performance and
security constraints.

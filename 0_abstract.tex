Full Drive Encryption (FDE) is essential for security in modern computing
systems, especially mobile systems. Recent work with stream-cipher based FDE
shows significantly improved throughput over block cipher based FDE while
offering stronger security guarantees. This approach is ideal when the only
optimization target is throughput; however, optimizing for high throughput often
conflicts with other key concerns like energy usage and the
cipher's security properties.

In this paper, we show that using stream ciphers for FDE creates a large tradeoff space that could be used to balance competing security and latency 
requirements.  We then present SwitchBox, a software
mechanism that enables dynamic navigation of these tradeoffs via \emph{cipher switching}, which
can be done in space or time. The key insight in this approach is achieving
low-overhead switching by leveraging the overwrite-averse, append-mostly
behavior of the underlying solid-state storage to trade throughput or total
energy use for desired security guarantees. We implement SwitchBox on an ARM
big.LITTLE mobile processor and test its performance under the popular F2FS LFS.
We provide empirical results that demonstrate the conditions under which different switching strategies would be optimal.
We then study SwitchBox's dynamic flexibility through XXX case studies where latency, energy, and security requirements change dynamically. In all cases, we find that SwicthBox achieves at least XXX improvement compared to static approaches that must pick only a single operating point. \TODO{We need a much stronger statement about the results, 
	but let's wait until all the case studies are in before we construct that 
	sentence.}

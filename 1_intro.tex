\TODO{There are many competing concerns modern systems must balance.}

Full-Drive Encryption (FDE) is important. What is what, what it does, why it's
important.

\TODO{Security (FDE) is one such important concern; performance and energy-use
are others.}

\TODO{Prior work on balancing these concerns is static and offline; a single
optimal configuration and cipher is chosen given only the most generic usecase; inflexible;
cannot adapt to changes in resource availability or runtime environment.}

Prior work focuses on performance vs the state of the art AES-XTS. Speedup is
accomplished using stream ciphers over block ciphers.

\TODO{However, prior work on using fast stream ciphers for FDE yield deeper
insights; performance win over AES-XTS comes from "append-mostly" behavior of
underlying LFS and we can leverage this further to create a mechanism for
changing ciphers online during runtime to meet dynamic latency, energy, and
security goals with minimal overhead.}

\TODO{Why this flexibility is useful and why anyone would want to pay some
overhead to take advantage of it: a taste of possibilities and the coming
usecases.}

\TODO{We present: SwitchBox!}

\TODO{We demonstrate SwitchBox's effectiveness on ...; we measure using ...; we further demonstrate with usecases ...}

\TODO{Explanation of remaining sections.}

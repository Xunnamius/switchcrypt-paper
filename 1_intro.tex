\TODO{There are many competing concerns modern systems must balance.}

Full-Drive Encryption (FDE) is important. What is what, what it does, why it's
important.

\TODO{Security (FDE) is one such important concern; performance and energy-use
are others.}

\TODO{Prior work on balancing these concerns is static and offline; a single
optimal configuration and cipher is chosen given only the most generic usecase; inflexible;
cannot adapt to changes in resource availability or runtime environment.}

Prior work focuses on performance vs the state of the art AES-XTS. Speedup is
accomplished using stream ciphers over block ciphers.

\TODO{However, prior work on using fast stream ciphers for FDE yield deeper
insights; performance win over AES-XTS comes from "append-mostly" behavior of
underlying LFS and we can leverage this further to create a mechanism for
changing ciphers online during runtime to meet dynamic latency, energy, and
security goals with minimal overhead.}

\TODO{Why this flexibility is useful and why anyone would want to pay some
overhead to take advantage of it: a taste of possibilities and the coming
usecases.}

\TODO{We present: SwitchBox!}

\TODO{We demonstrate SwitchBox's effectiveness on ...; we measure using ...; we further demonstrate with usecases ...}

\TODO{Explanation of remaining sections.}

Motivation in this section? Figures that demonstrate ciphers.

A point somewhere about when to use different strategies.

List of concerns that determine when to switch to what and why.

Liberal use of todos as placeholders.

Current state of the art misses one goal or the other. Oracle knowledge is too slow. Dynamic is only one that works.

Equate flexibility with the ability to operate between the static points. Repeat this wording in the evaluation section.

\subsection{\sysB: Cipher Wrapper Interfaces}\label{subsec:des-crypts}

% About: challenge, input, output
One of the goals of \sys is that we might use any stream cipher regardless of
its implementation details. However, allowing these ciphers to co-exist in the
same volume is challenging since there are many cipher implementations that we
might use, each with unique input requirements and output considerations. For
instance, Salsa and Chacha implementations require a certain IV and key size and
handle plaintext input through successive invocations of a single state update
function~\cite{Floodyberry}. Using OpenSSL's AES implementation in CTR mode
requires manually tracking the counter state and individual ciphertext blocks
are retrieved though corresponding function invocations~\cite{OpenSSL}.
Freestyle's reference implementation requires we calculate the extra space
necessary per nugget (due to ciphertext expansion) along with
configuration-dependent minimum and maximum rounds-per-block, hash interval, and
pepper bits~\cite{Freestyle}. HC-128 and other ciphers have similarly disparate
requirements.

Further, unlike prior work, \sys must encrypt and decrypt arbitrary nuggets {\em
with any of these ciphers} at any moment with low overhead and without tight
coupling to any specific implementation detail. Hence, we must abstract away
these input and output requirements by decoupling cipher implementations from
the core encryption process. We present \sysB, a collection of interfaces that
allow implementors to write light (<100 LOC) wrapper functions around cipher
implementations without modifications to third-party code; we call these wrapped
ciphers {\em crypts}. Crypts present \sys with a uniform encryption and
decryption interface across all cipher implementations, enabling normally
incompatible ciphers to encrypt and decrypt arbitrary nuggets and thus coexist
under \sys.

% About: single enc/dec model, the OS has one way to talk to \sys
The ability for disparate cipher implementations to co-exist in this way forms
the foundation for \sys's ability to switch the system between different cipher
configurations efficiently and effectively. To facilitate this, \sysB acts as a
translation layer between the encryption module (where \sysA is implemented) and
storage (where \sysB output is committed).

\sys receives I/Os from the operating system at the block device level like any
other device-mapper. These I/Os come in the form of either reads or writes. When
a read is received, the OS hands \sys an offset and a length and expects a
response with plaintext of that specific length starting at that specific offset
taken from the beginning of storage. When a write is received, the OS hands \sys
an offset, a length, and a buffer of plaintext and expects that plaintext to be
encrypted and committed to storage such that the plaintext is later retrievable
given that same offset and length in a future read.

Crypts handle these I/Os by implementing either \texttt{xor\_interface} or both
\texttt{read\_interface} and \texttt{write\_interface}. These interfaces are
implemented by crypt authors and later called by the encryption module when
encrypting, re-ciphering, and decrypting nuggets during I/O.

% ---------------------------------- xor interface

\texttt{xor\_interface} executes independently of \sys internals and treats
encryption and decryption as the same operation. Crypts receive an integer
offset $F$, an integer length $L$, a key buffer $K$ corresponding to the current
nugget, and an empty $L$-length XOR buffer. \sys expects the XOR buffer to be
populated with $L$ bytes of keystream output from some stream cipher seeked to
offset $F$ with respect to key $K$. The the key buffer length will always be
what the cipher implementation expects, alleviating the burden of key
management. Similarly, the XOR buffer will be XOR-ed with the appropriate nugget
contents automatically, alleviating the burden of drive access and other tedious
calculations.

% ---------------------------------- read/write interface

\texttt{read\_interface} and \texttt{write\_interface}, on the other hand, treat
encryption and decryption as distinct concerns. \texttt{read\_interface} handles
decryption and re-ciphering during reads. \texttt{write\_interface} handles
encryption and re-ciphering during writes. Crypts receive full access to \sys
internals, giving wrapper code deep hooks into the encryption and decryption
process and allowing implementers to bypass parts of the nugget-based storage
layout if necessary. This comes at the cost of increased code complexity and
potential performance implications, since \sys must account for not having
absolute control over its internal data structures when using this crypt.

For this work we have implemented \numConfigs crypts using \numCiphers
ciphers---ChaCha, Rabbit, Sosemanuk, AES-CTR, and HC-128 with
\texttt{xor\_interface}; Freestyle and AES-XTS with \texttt{read\_interface} and
\texttt{write\_interface}---each in under 100 LOC (excluding the cipher
algorithm itself).

\begin{abstract}

This document is intended to serve as a sample for submissions to the
26th International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming
Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS), 2021.  It provides
guidelines that authors should follow when submitting papers to the
conference. 

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

This document provides instructions for submitting papers to the 26th
International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming
Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS), 2021.  In an effort to
respect the efforts of reviewers and in the interest of fairness to
all prospective authors, we request that all submissions to ASPLOS
2021 follow the formatting and submission rules detailed below.
Submissions that violate these instructions may not be reviewed, at the
discretion of the program co-chairs.

The submission instructions are also available in this
\href{https://asplos-conference.org/submissions/}{this website},
including a link to the paper submission site. The website contains
sample PDF files for the
\href{https://asplos-conference.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/asplos21-paper-template.pdf}{paper} and
\href{https://asplos-conference.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/asplos21-extended-abstract-template.pdf}{extended abstract}. The
sample files are formatted using the ASPLOS'21 submission format and
contain the submission and formatting guidelines. The website also
includes an \href{https://asplos-conference.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/asplos21-templates.zip}{archive file}
with \LaTeX~templates for both papers and extended abstracts.

All questions regarding paper formatting and submission should be directed
to the program co-chairs.

\paragraph{Important highlights:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Papers should contain a
maximum of 10 pages of single-spaced two-column text, including any
appendixes, but not including references.
\item All submitted papers must be accompanied by an extended
  abstract, in a separate file with a maximum of 
2 pages of single-spaced two-column text, not including references.
\item Papers and extended abstracts must be submitted in printable PDF format.
\item Text must be in a minimum 10pt ({\bf not} 9pt) font.
\item No page limit for references for papers and the extended abstracts.
\item Each reference must specify {\em all} authors (no {\em et al.}).
\item Authors of {\em all} accepted papers will be required
  to record a short (less than 2 minute) video that previews the paper.
  This video substitutes for a lightning talk.
  Additional requirements for the video will be forthcoming.
\item Authors of {\em all} accepted papers will be required to have a poster in addition to the regular
conference talk.
\item Proceedings will appear in the ACM digital library up to two weeks
before the conference.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Paper evaluation objectives:}
The committee will make every effort to fairly judge each submitted paper on
its own merits. There will be no target acceptance rate.  We expect to
accept a wide range of papers with appropriate expectations for
evaluation. Papers that build on significant past work with
strong evaluations are valuable,  We encourage you to consider the
\href{https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/EmpiricalEvaluation/}{SIGPLAN
  empirical evaluation guidelines} for the evaluation of the ideas in
your paper. At the same time,  papers that open new areas with less
rigorous evaluation are equally welcome and especially encouraged.
Given the wide range of topics covered by ASPLOS, every effort will be
made to find expert reviewers.

This year, ASPLOS will pilot the use of extended abstracts. {\bf All
  papers submissions must be accompanied by a 2-page extended
  abstract, submitted as a separate PDF file}.  Extended abstracts
will be used throughout the reviewing process so that a larger number
of PC members have a better understanding of each paper as they made
decisions. {\bf The extended abstract and the paper must be independent (standalone) documents that a reviewer can read separately. Since reviewers will have access to both documents, authors can trim the introductory material in the paper. The extended abstract can refer to figures and sections in the main paper.}

ASPLOS'21 will also feature Artifact Evaluation for accepted papers. 
Although encouraged, Artifact Evaluation submission is not required nor will 
it be used as a condition for paper acceptance into ASPLOS 2021. Reviewers will 
not have visibility into the availability of such artifacts. We request that 
authors do not refer to them in their paper submissions.

\section{Paper and Abstract Preparation Instructions}

Formatting instructions and \LaTeX~ templates for the paper and
extended abstract can be found on
\href{https://asplos-conference.org/submissions/}{this website}.

\subsection{Paper Formatting}

Papers must be submitted in printable PDF format and should contain a
{\bf maximum of 10 pages} of single-spaced two-column text, including any
appendixes, but {\bf not
  including references}.  You may include any number of pages for
references, but see below for more instructions.  If you are using
\LaTeX~\cite{lamport94} to typeset your paper, then we suggest that
you use \href{https://asplos-conference.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/asplos21-templates.zip}{this template}.
If you use a different
software package to typeset your paper, then please adhere to the
guidelines given in Table~\ref{table:formatting}.

\begin{table}[h!]

  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Field} & \textbf{Value}\\

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Formatting guidelines for submission. }
  \label{table:formatting}
\end{table}

\textbf{Please ensure that you include page numbers with your
submission}. This makes it easier for the reviewers to refer to different
parts of your paper when they provide comments.

Please ensure that your submission has a banner at the top of the title
page, as shown in
\href{https://asplos-conference.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/asplos21-paper-template.pdf}{this
sample paper}, which contains the submission number and the notice of
confidentiality.  If using the template, just replace XXX with your
submission number.

\subsection{Extended Abstract Formatting}

The extended abstracts must be submitted in printable PDF format and should contain a
{\bf maximum of 2 pages} of single-spaced two-column text, {\bf not
  including references}.  You may include any number of pages for
references, but see below for more instructions. The extended
abstracts should use the same formatting as the papers (see \href{https://asplos-conference.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/asplos21-paper-template.pdf}{the
paper formatting instructions}. If you are using
\LaTeX~\cite{lamport94} to typeset your extended abstract, then we suggest that
you use
\href{https://asplos-conference.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/asplos21-templates.zip}{this
  template} that also describes that information to include in your
extended abstract. 

\subsection{Content}

\noindent\textbf{Author List.}  Reviewing will be \textbf{double blind};
therefore, please \textbf{do not include any author names on any submitted
documents except in the space provided on the submission form}.  You must
also ensure that the metadata included in the PDF does not give away the
authors. If you are improving upon your prior work, refer to your prior
work in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the
bibliography.  For example, if you are building on {\em your own} prior
work in the papers \cite{nicepaper1,nicepaper2,nicepaper3}, you would say
something like: "While the authors of
\cite{nicepaper1,nicepaper2,nicepaper3} did X, Y, and Z, this paper
additionally does W, and is therefore much better."  Do NOT omit or
anonymize references for blind review. There is one exception to this for
your own prior work that appeared in IEEE CAL, workshops without archived
proceedings, etc.\, as discussed later in this document.

\noindent\textbf{Figures and Tables.} Ensure that the figures and tables
are legible.  Please also ensure that you refer to your figures in the main
text.  Many reviewers print the papers in gray-scale. Therefore, if you use
colors for your figures, ensure that the different colors are highly
distinguishable in gray-scale.

\noindent\textbf{References.}  There is no length limit for references.
{\bf Each reference must explicitly list all authors of the paper.  Papers
not meeting this requirement will be rejected.} Authors of NSF proposals
should be familiar with this requirement. Knowing all authors of related
work will help find the best reviewers. Since there is no length limit
for the number of pages used for references, there is no need to save space
here.

\section{Paper and Abstract Submission Instructions}

\subsection{Declaring Authors}

Declare all the authors of the paper up front. Addition/removal of authors
once the paper is accepted will have to be approved by the program co-chairs,
since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for
reviewer assignment.

\subsection{Areas and Topics}

ASPLOS emphasizes multidisciplinary research. Submissions should ideally
emphasize synergy of two or more ASPLOS areas: architecture, programming
languages, operating systems, and related areas (broadly
interpreted). Authors should indicate these areas on the submission form as
well as specific topics covered by the paper for optimal reviewer match. If
you are unsure whether your paper falls within the scope of ASPLOS, please
check with the program co-chair -- ASPLOS is a broad, multidisciplinary
conference and encourages new topics.

\subsection{Declaring Conflicts of Interest}

Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site.
Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers.
If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes
a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to
abuse or ``game'' the review system, the paper may be rejected.

Please declare a conflict of interest (COI) with the following people
for any author of your paper:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students,
      and post-doctoral advisees, forever.
\item Family relations by blood or marriage and close friends, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). You are a close friend with someone if you have or would spend a night at their home if you were visiting them, or vice versa.
\item People with whom you have collaborated in the last four years, including
\begin{itemize}
\item co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending papers.
\item co-PIs on accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals.
\item funders (decision-makers) of your research grants, and researchers
      whom you fund.
\end{itemize}
\item People (including students) who shared your primary institution(s) in the
last four years.
\end{enumerate}

``Service'' collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional
organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting
tutorials, do not themselves create a conflict of interest.
Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects with
no true collaboration among the projects does not constitute a
conflict among the authors of the different projects.

On the other hand, there may be others not covered by the above with whom
you believe a COI exists, for example, close personal friends.
Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them.
Please be reasonable.	For example, you cannot declare a COI with a
reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or
related to those in your paper.
The program co-chairs may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear.

We hope to draw most reviewers from the PC and the ERC, but others from the
community may also write reviews.  Please declare all your conflicts (not
just restricted to the PC and ERC).  When in doubt, contact the program
co-chairs.

\subsection{Concurrent Submissions and Workshops}

By submitting a manuscript to ASPLOS'21, the authors guarantee that the
manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in
a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or workshop. The
only exceptions are (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in
the ACM digital library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper
appear in the archived proceedings), or (2) venues, such as IEEE CAL, where
there is an explicit policy that such publication does not preclude longer
conference submissions. These are not considered prior publications. 
Technical reports and papers posted on public social media sites, Web pages,
or online repositories, such as arxiv.org, are not considered prior
publications either. In these cases, the submitted manuscript may
ignore the posted work to preserve author anonymity. 
The authors also guarantee that no paper that contains
significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted paper will be
under review for any other conference, journal, or workshop during the
ASPLOS'21 review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to
rejection.  As always, if you are in doubt, it is best to contact the
program co-chairs.  Finally, we also note that the ACM Plagiarism Policy
(http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism\_policy) covers a range
of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one's
own work.

\subsection{Ethical Obligations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members to encourage or solicit them to bid on any paper.
\item Authors are not allowed to attempt to sway a reviewer to review any paper positively or negatively.
\item Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing process, either in general or specifically about submitted papers.
\item Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC members to ask about the outcomes of any papers.
\item Authors must also abide by the
  \href{https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics}{ACM ethics
    policy}. Violation of the ACM ethics policy may result in
  rejection of the submission and possible action by the ACM.
 \item Authors are not allowed to advertise their submissions or related technical reports and postings (e.g., to arxiv.org or online repositories) on social media or community blogs and webpages during the period starting two weeks before the submission deadline and ending when the ASPLOS’21 acceptance results are public.
\end{itemize}

\section{Early Access in the Digital Library}

The ASPLOS'21 proceedings will be freely available via the ACM Digital
Library for up to two weeks before and up to a month after the
conference. {\bf Authors must consider any implications of this early
disclosure of their work {\em before} submitting their papers.}

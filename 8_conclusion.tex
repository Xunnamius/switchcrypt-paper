\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This paper advocates for a more flexible approach to FDE where the storage
system can dynamically adjust the tradeoffs between security and latency/energy.
To support this vision of agile encryption, we proposed an interface that allows
multiple stream ciphers with different input and output characteristics to be
composed in a generic manner. We have identified three strategies for using this
interface to switch ciphers dynamically and with low overhead. We have also
proposed a quantification framework for determining when to use one cipher over
another. Our case studies show how different strategies can be used to optimize
for different goals in practice. We believe that agile encryption will become
increasingly important as successful systems are increasingly required to
balance conflicting operational requirements. We hope that this work inspires
further research in achieving this balance.\PUNT{Our work is publicly available

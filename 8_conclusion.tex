\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

Stream ciphers are fast and offer strong security properties, but optimizing for
performance often conflicts with other key concerns. In this paper we presented
SwitchCrypt to navigate the security and latency/energy tradeoff space via
\emph{cipher switching} in space and time. We provided empirical results
demonstrating the conditions under which different switching strategies are
optimal and explored four related cases. In all cases, we found that SwitchCrypt
achieves reduced energy usage and I/O latency compared to static approaches.

  abstract =     "The database-as-a-service (DAS) model is a newly
                 emerging computing paradigm, where the DBMS functions
                 are outsourced. It is desirable to store data on
                 database servers in encrypted form to reduce security
                 and privacy risks since the server may not be fully
                 trusted. But this usually implies that one has to
                 sacrifice functionality and efficiency for security.
                 Several approaches have been proposed in recent
                 literature for efficiently supporting queries on
                 encrypted databases. These approaches differ from each
                 other in how the index of attribute values is created.
                 Random one-to-one mapping and order-preserving are two
                 examples. In this paper we will adapt a
                 prefix-preserving encryption scheme to create the
                 index. Certainly, all these approaches look for a
                 convenient trade-off between efficiency and security.
                 In this paper we will discuss the security issues and
                 efficiency of these approaches for supporting range
                 queries on encrypted numeric data.",

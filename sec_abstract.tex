We introduce \sys, a secure storage system that provides block level kernel
support for {\em heterogeneous Full Drive Encryption} (FDE). Recent work on Full
Drive Encryption shows that stream ciphers achieve significantly improved
performance over block ciphers while offering stronger security guarantees.
However, optimizing for performance conflicts with concerns like energy
efficiency and security. \sys takes advantage of the latent tradeoff space by
balancing competing concerns via {\em cipher switching}. Our key insight in
achieving low-overhead switching is to leverage the overwrite-averse,
append-mostly behavior of underlying solid-state storage to trade throughput for
reduced energy use and/or certain security properties. We implement \sys on an
ARM big.LITTLE mobile processor and test its performance under the popular F2FS
file system. Our evaluation shows that \sys heterogeneous FDE enables secure,
flexible, high performance FDE with low overhead.

We introduce \sys, a storage system that provides block level kernel support for
{\em heterogeneous Full Drive Encryption} (FDE). Recent work on Full Drive
Encryption shows that stream ciphers achieve significantly improved performance
while offering stronger storage security guarantees. However, optimizing for
performance conflicts with concerns like battery life. \sys takes advantage of
the vast configuration space of stream ciphers to balance these concerns with
{\em cipher switching}. Our key insight in achieving low-overhead switching is
to leverage the append-mostly behavior of underlying solid-state storage to
dynamically optimize for performance, increased battery life, or powerful
security properties. We implement \sys on an ARM big.LITTLE mobile processor and
test its performance under the popular F2FS file system. Our evaluation shows
\sys cipher switching enables secure, flexible, high performance heterogeneous
FDE with reasonable overhead costs.

\section{Implementation}\label{sec:impl}

Our \sys implementation consists of \locTotal lines of C code (excluding
StrongBox components we re-use as is). To ensure high quality code, we also
wrote a \locTest line test suite. Our implementation is available open
source~\footnoteref{ftn:foss}. We deploy \sys on top of the BUSE virtual block
device~\cite{BUSE} as our device controller. BUSE is a thin (200 LoC) wrapper
around the standard Linux Network Block Device (NBD), allowing our system to
transact block layer requests in user space, reducing implementation complexity.

Among the many ciphers \sys supports, we focus on the five implementations
described here for our evaluation and cases studies: ChaCha8,
ChaCha20~\cite{ChaCha20}, and Freestyle~\cite{Freestyle} in three different
configurations: a ``fast'' mode with parameters
\texttt{FFast($R_{min}$=$8$,$R_{max}$=$20$,$H_I$=$4$,$I_C$=$8$)}, a ``balanced''
mode with parameters \texttt{FBalanced($R_{min}$=$12$,
$R_{max}$=$28$,$H_I$=$2$,$I_C$=$10$)}, and a ``strong'' mode with parameters
\texttt{FStrong($R_{min}$=$20$,$R_{max}$=$36$,$H_I$=$1$,$I_C$=$12$)}.

Table \cref{tbl:impl} shows the cipher implementations we use (wrapped into
crypts with \sysB; see \cref{subsec:des-crypts}).

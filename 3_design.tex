\section{\SYSTEM{} Design}\label{sec:design}

\TODO{How much of the original StrongBox should be explained here? Is
this too much? Too little?}

\SYSTEM{}, like StrongBox, is a translation layer positioned between the block
layer and the operating system's virtual file system~\cite{StrongBox}. There are
several places \SYSTEM{} could be implemented in the system stack: as part of an
actual kernel Log-structured File System (LFS) module like the F2FS filesystem,
as a block device or virtual block device in the manner of dm-crypt, or within a
device controller such as an SSD drive controller's FTL~\cite{StrongBox}.

\figref{overview} illustrates the \SYSTEM{} design. \SYSTEM{} manages five
metadata components: an in-memory \emph{Merkle Tree}; two drive-backed byte
arrays, \ie{the \emph{Keycount Store} and the \emph{Transaction Journal}}; a
globally persistent cryptographically secure monotonic counter; and a flexible
drive-backed store for per-nugget cipher-specific metadata. For our
monotonic counter implementation, we used a \emph{Replay Protected Memory Block}
(RPMB).

These five components are tightly integrated into the cryptographic driver,
which handles data encryption, decryption, overwrite detection, integrity
protection, communication with the wider system to determine the active cipher,
and the application of cipher switching strategies. The cryptographic driver
interacts with 1) the overlying LFS through traditional I/O passed through the
Linux Virtual Filesystem Switch (VFS) as well as 2) the underlying backing store
through the device controller block I/O layer.

\end{figure}

The backing store is the storage medium \SYSTEM{} operates on. The layout of the
backing store is illustrated with \figref{backstore}. \TODO{Do we redescribe the
backing store from StrongBox, or should we link to the original paper? Or should
we skip talking about the backing store at all and just briefly describe nuggets
here? It's not very different from StrongBox's. An extra header was added.}

In the rest of this section, we describe our cipher switching strategies,
pluggable stream cipher API, and related design challenges with these
components. This is followed by an explanation of implementation-specific
details and a discussion of the overall implications and limitations of
\SYSTEM{}'s design.

\subsection{Cipher Switching Strategies}

Upon initialization, prior work requires a single cipher to be selected. The
specified cipher---ideally along the pareto frontier---is then used to encrypt
and decrypt all data on the filesystem. With \SYSTEM{}, however, \emph{a pair of
ciphers are selected} upon initialization, depending on the concerns of the
end-user. These ciphers are referred to as the \emph{primary cipher} and the
\emph{secondary cipher} respectively, and represent the static configuration
points along the pareto frontier between which \SYSTEM{} can navigate.

At any moment, the currently active cipher is used to interact with the backing
store. Initially, the primary cipher is the active cipher. Until the wider
system indicates that \SYSTEM{} should use a different cipher to interact with
the backing store, \SYSTEM{} functions identically to StrongBox in that it uses
the primary cipher to encrypt and decrypt all nuggets during I/O.

However, switching the active cipher dynamically allows \SYSTEM{} to achieve
optimal configuration points that are otherwise unachievable with prior work.
The wider system determines if the primary or secondary cipher should be the
active cipher at any given moment, and \SYSTEM{} responds immediately.
Unfortunately, it is entirely non-trivial to determine \emph{when} to re-encrypt
a nugget with a different cipher and \emph{where} to direct the output of that
cipher.

Hence, cipher switching \emph{strategies} are the mechanism by which \SYSTEM{}
can effectively transition nuggets between different encrypted states
dynamically, thus providing a mechanism to navigate the tradeoff space presented
in
\figref{fig:40mb-read-with-forward}. \TODO{Expound on this all more? Reword? Delete?}

\subsubsection{Forward}

\SYSTEM{} allows each individual nugget to exist encrypted using one cipher or
the other regardless of the currently active cipher. When a nugget is
encountered during I/O that is encrypted using a cipher other than the active
cipher, however, the forward strategy dictates that this nugget be re-encrypted
"just-in-time" using the active cipher before completing the I/O operation. If a
particular nugget encrypted with the non-active cipher is never encountered
during I/O, it is never re-encrypted and remains on the backing store in its
original state. In this way, the forward strategy represents a form of temporal
cipher switching.

Rather than re-encrypt the entire backing store every time the active cipher
changes, this strategy limits the performance impact of cipher switching to
individual nuggets. Similar to rekeying in the original StrongBox construction,
the heavy price of re-encryption is paid only once during the initial
re-encryption, after which the nugget is accessed normally during I/O until the
active cipher is switched again.

There are several forms the forward strategy can take. The default and most
intuitive is \emph{0-forward}, in which \SYSTEM{} immediately transitions
individual nuggets encountered during I/O to the active cipher is they are not
using it. Over time, if various I/O operations end up touching every nugget in
the backing store, the encrypted state of every nugget will eventually become
consistent with the currently active cipher.

The forward strategy can also take the form of \emph{N-forward}, where \SYSTEM{}
attempts to take advantage of spatial sequential locality to transition whole
sets of nuggets into the active cipher. We can trivially expand the forward
strategy to encompass the entire backing store by selecting N equal to the total
number of nuggets managed by \SYSTEM{}. This would have the effect of
re-encrypting large swaths of the backing store upon every I/O operation where a
nugget encrypted with the non-active cipher is encountered. Of course, this has
the same effect as simply re-initializing the entire filesystem with the new
cipher.

\subsubsection{Selective}

When \SYSTEM{} is initialized with the selective strategy, the backing store is
partitioned into two regions governed exclusively by the primary and secondary
ciphers, respectively. All nuggets in the first partition are encrypted with the
primary cipher while all nuggets in the second partition are encrypted with the
secondary cipher.

Hence, unlike the forward strategy, which schedules individual nuggets to be
re-encrypted at some point in time \emph{after} the active cipher is switched,
the selective strategy allows the wider system to indicate \emph{where} on the
backing store a read or write operation should occur: either in one partition or
the other. In this way, the selective strategy represents a form of spatial
cipher switching where different regions of the backing store can store
different pieces of data.

\subsubsection{Mirrored}

Similar to the selective strategy, when \SYSTEM{} is initialized with the
mirrored strategy, the backing store is partitioned into two regions governed
exclusively by the primary and secondary ciphers, respectively. All nuggets in
the first partition are encrypted with the primary cipher while all nuggets in
the second partition are encrypted with the secondary cipher.

However, unlike the selective strategy, all write operations that hit one
partition are mirrored into the other partition immediately. The mirrored
strategy merely allows the wider system to indicate where on the backing store a
\emph{read} operation should occur. As a result, both regions of the backing
store will always be in a consistent state and share the same data. In this way,
the mirrored strategy, like the selective strategy, represents a form of spatial
cipher switching.

\subsection{Implementation}

Our \SYSTEM{} implementation consists of 9,491 lines of C code; our test suite
consists of 6,077 lines of C code. All together, our solution is comprised of
15,568 lines of C code.

\SYSTEM{} uses OpenSSL version 1.1.0h and LibSodium version 1.0.12 for its
AES-XTS and AES-CTR implementations. Open source ARM NEON optimized
implementations of ChaCha are provided by Floodyberry~\cite{Floodyberry}. The
Freestyle cipher implementation is from the original paper~\cite{Freestyle}. The
eSTREAM Profile 1 cipher implementations are from the open source libestream
cryptographic library~\cite{libestream} by Lucas Clemente Vella. As with the
original StrongBox, the Merkle Tree implementation is from the Secure Block
Device~\cite{SBD}. \SYSTEM{} implementation is publicly available
open-source.\footnote{\SystemURI}.

For a fair comparison with the original StrongBox implementation, we mirror
their use of the BUSE~\cite{BUSE} virtual block device as our device controller.
BUSE is a thin (200 LoC) wrapper around the standard Linux Network Block Device
(NBD). Buse allows an operating system to transact block I/O requests to and
from virtual block devices exposed via domain socket.

For the purposes of our implementation, we make the choice of ciphers binary:
either the system wants \SYSTEM{} to access the backing store using the primary
cipher or the secondary cipher. However, there is no technical limitation
preventing various different nuggets encrypted with three, four, or more unique
ciphers from co-existing on the backing store.

\subsubsection{Indicating a cipher switch should occur}

When \SYSTEM{} should be using the primary cipher or the secondary cipher to
interact with the backing store, this intent is communicated via POSIX message
queue in our implementation. It is not a requirement of \SYSTEM{} that a POSIX
message queue be used over any other method of inter-process communication so
long as \SYSTEM{} is notified asynchronously when the wider system desires one
cipher be active over the other.

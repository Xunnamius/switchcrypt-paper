\section{Case Studies}\label{sec:usecases}

In this section we conclude our case studies. See \cref{sec:eval} for the setup
and methodology behind each study.


% ===========================================================
\subsection{``Battery Saver'' Mode}\label{subsec:usecase-battery}

% About: background
In this first case study, we revisit the motivational Forward switching example
(\cref{sec:motivation}). Our goal is to complete a workload within a strict
energy budget. Here, our netbook's storage will use {\em Freestyle Balanced (FB)}
when operating normally and {\em ChaCha8 (C8)} when battery saver mode is
activated.

\input{graphics/fig-usecase-battery}

% About: setup
To simulate this, we repeat the following twice: 1) we begin writing 10 40MB
files using FB. 2) After five seconds, our device simulates battery saver mode
by pinning \sys processes to the energy-efficient LITTLE cores and underclocking
them to lowest frequency. 3) We complete the workload.

% About: outcome
The workload is completed homogeneously on the first run. On the second, when
entering battery saver mode we switch to C8 using the Forward switching model.
\Cref{fig:usecase-battery} shows the total energy used after completing both
runs. {\em Homogeneous} FDE (left) favors security even when backups are paused
while \sys (right) Forward switches when in battery saver mode. These results
show using \sys resulted in a \TODO{3.3x} total energy reduction compared to
prior work using homogeneous FDE, allowing us to remain safely within our energy
budget.


% ===============================
\subsection{No-Downtime Encryption Upgrade}\label{subsec:usecase-upgrade}

% About: background
In this second case study we revisit the Mirrored switching example
(\cref{subsec:des-switch}). Our goal is to upgrade live storage from one cipher
to another without downtime or degraded service. Our operator wants to upgrade
from {\em ChaCha20 (C20)} to {\em Freestyle Fast (FF)}.

% About: setup
To simulate pre- and post-migration state, we execute 10 5MB write-read
operations to two \sys instances using C20 and FF respectively. To simulate the
activity during migration, we repeat the operations on a third instance using
Mirrored switching.

\input{graphics/fig-usecase-upgrade}

% About: outcome
\Cref{fig:usecase-upgrade} shows the overhead on I/O performance at three stages
of migration. On the left we see similar read latency between pre-, during-, and
post-migration workloads of \TODO{X}s. On the right, we see write latency
increase by \TODO{X}s during the migration but recover post-migration. Thus,
unlike inflexible prior work, \sys successfully allows one to transition storage
to another cipher without interruption or egregious performance loss.


% ================================================================
\subsection{Scalable Encryption}\label{subsec:usecase-scalable}

% About: background
In this final case study we revisit the Selective switching example
(\cref{subsec:des-switch}). Our goal is to achieve a performance win by ensuring
that the only data encrypted using the strongest highest-overhead crypt is the
small percentage of data that needs it. We note the Selective switching model
requires users to annotate certain files with a special tag via file system
calls and stored in the inode. Because the \sys layer is file-oblivious, every
block I/O through the \sys layer will be labeled with the corresponding crypt.

% About: setup
We begin with 10 5MB and 10 4KB write-read operations to two \sys instances: one
using {\em ChaCha8 (C8)}, a high performance crypt, and the other using {\em
Freestyle Strong (FS)}, a high security crypt. We repeat the operations on a
third instance using Selective switching where 30\% of the data is considered
highly sensitive and uses FS.

\input{graphics/fig-usecase-scalable}

% About: outcome
\Cref{fig:usecase-scalable} shows {\em Homogeneous} FDE (left) exhibits 5s to
20s latency depending on the workload while \sys (right) outperforms with a
reduction of \TODO{3.1x to 4.8x for read latency and 1.6x to 2.8x for write
latency}, all without compromising on security. Thus, \sys keeps our sensitive
data at the mandated security level while keeping the performance benefits of
fast crypto.

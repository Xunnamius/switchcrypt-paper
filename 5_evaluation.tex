Evaluate switching strategies against themselves. Different workloads, different size, etc. Show that overhead is low. Show that performance is maintained.

Paper up until this point makes assertions about static, offline, not flexible. Evaluation shows flexibility.

Show the graph that demonstrates that we have a method to navigate this space.

What assertions were made? Show results that demonstrate this.

This stuff works. Next section, show usefulness in practical circumstances.

\TODO{A point somewhere about when to use different strategies. List of concerns that determine when to switch to what and why.}

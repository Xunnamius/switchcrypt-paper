Evaluate switching strategies against themselves. Different workloads, different size, etc. Show that overhead is low. Show that performance is maintained.

Show the graph that demonstrates that we have a method to navigate this space.

What assertions were made? Show results that demonstrate this.

This stuff works. Next section, show usefulness in practical circumstances.

\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We implement \SYSTEM{} on a Hardkernel Odroid XU3 ARM big.LITTLE system with
Samsung Exynos 5422 A15/A7 heterogeneous multi-processing quad core CPUs at
maximum clock speed, 2 gigabyte LPDDR3 RAM at 933 MHz, and an eMMC5.0 HS400
backing store running Ubuntu Trusty 14.04.6 LTS, kernel version 3.10.106.

The maximum theoretical memory bandwidth for this model is 14.9GB/s\@. Our
observed maximum memory bandwidth is 4.5GB/s.

\subsection{Experimental Methodology}

In this section we answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Can \SYSTEM{} reach dynamic configuration points in the tradeoff space?
 \item What is the performance overhead of each cipher switching strategy?
 \item What is the metadata overhead of each cipher switching strategy?
 \item What switching strategy works best in which scenario? For which workload?
\end{enumerate}

\figref{navigating-the-space} shows the 40MB read performance of three ciphers:
ChaCha8, ChaCha20, and Freestyle in its "fast" configuration. This illustrates
the tradeoff space between latency/energy and security for these three static
discrete pareto optimal configurations achievable offline via prior work.
\figref{navigating-the-space} additionally illustrates the flexibility of
\SYSTEM{} using the 0-forward switching strategy to reach pareto optimal dynamic
configuration points \emph{between} traditional static configuration in the
tradeoff space that are unachievable via prior work.

\TODO{Should there be a "ciphers" section somewhere that describes all the
various ciphers and cipher configurations? Would that best go in the design
section? Or perhaps here in the evaluation?}
